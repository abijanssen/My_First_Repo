        <p>Hey, yo, what's up. This is my first time coding, and I'm gonna tell you about my uncle, Niko.</p>

          <p>This is Niko, he's an actor. Some things he's been in are:</p>
          <ol>The OA</ol>
          <ol>Mile 22</ol>
          <ol>Power Rangers</ol>
          <ol>Stranger Things</ol>
          
          <p>In 2020 after taking too much THC, he bought 40 air streams. Here is a  picture:</p>

          <p>Don't let me fool you with this image though. His are definitely not this cool.</p>
          
          <p>He even had to buy a truck to pull them as he didn't even own a car when he bought them. The vehicle he chose is a grey ram dually which he named "tiny". He cruises around LA in his massive truck named Tiny and it is very comical.</p>
